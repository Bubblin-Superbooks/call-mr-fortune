You know very well that if I wanted to charge Kimball on this evidence it would be turned down. I couldn’t force the issue without a stronger case. Do have some sense of the practical.”</p><p>Reggie smiled. “I’m not blaming you. I only want to rub it in.”</p><p>“Thanks very much. We are to suspect Kimball, I suppose.”</p><p>“Like the devil, and watch him.”</p><p>“I see. Yes, I think we shall be quite justified in watching Mr. Kimball. But, my dear fellow, you are rather odd this morning. If you want Kimball watched, why the devil do you handle him so violently? You know, you almost accused him of the murder. Anything more likely to put him on his guard I can’t imagine.”</p></div> </div>
