I have some which is at your service if you can satisfy me why you want it.—Yours truly, Jane Brown.”</p><p>“I should say Jane is a character,” said Lomas.</p><p>“Yes, she allured me. I told her who I was and she said she’d come to tea.”</p><p>She kept her appointment. Reggie found himself facing a large young woman. In her construction nature had been very happy. She had decorated its work with admirable art. She was physically in the grand style, but she had a merry eye, and her clothes were not only charming but of a sophisticated elegance.</p><p>Reggie, there is no doubt, stared at her for a moment and a half. “Miss—Jane—Brown,” he said slowly.</p><p>“I haven’t brought my godfathers and godmothers, Mr. Fortune,” she smiled. “But I am Jane Brown really. I always felt I couldn’t live up to it. I see you know me.”</p></div> </div>
