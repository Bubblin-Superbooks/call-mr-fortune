The Archduke, who was drinking tea, was pleased to receive Mr. Lomas. He also received Reggie. “Dr. Fortune? You have something to tell me?”</p><p>“There is no change, sir.”</p><p>“No change yet! And you gave me such hopes this morning. These are anxious hours, Mr. Lomas.”</p><p>“I can imagine it, sir. But I hope to relieve some of your anxieties. I believe we shall discover who was responsible for last night’s outrage.”</p><p>“So! And so soon! But you are wonderful, you English police. You will sit down, Mr. Lomas.” He looked at Reggie, whose lingering naturally surprised him. “Is there anything more, Dr. Fortune?”</p><p>“Dr. Fortune is part of my evidence, sir,” said Lomas.</p></div> </div>
