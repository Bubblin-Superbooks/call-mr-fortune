An impressive thing, Lomas, old dear.”</p><p>“So it is,” Lomas nodded. “One meets cases of the kind, but never quite of so pure a style. Upon my soul, Fortune, it has a sort of grandeur—the intensity of purpose, the contempt for ordinary values, the absolute uselessness of it. And it was damned clever.”</p><p>Reggie chose a cigar. “Great work,” he sighed. “All the marks of the real great man, if it wasn’t diabolical. He was a great man, but for the hate in him. Just like the devil.”</p><p>“You’re so moral,” Lomas protested. “Don’t you feel the beauty of it?”</p></div> </div>
